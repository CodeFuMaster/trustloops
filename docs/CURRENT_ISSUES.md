# Current Issues & Solutions

## Issue 1: Project Creation Not Displaying in UI

### Problem
- Projects are being created successfully in the backend (confirmed in logs)
- Frontend Dashboard doesn't show newly created projects
- Only shows hardcoded "Sample Product"

### Root Cause
The `ProjectService.GetUserProjectsAsync()` method only returns a hardcoded sample project instead of actual user projects.

### Solution Required
1. Implement actual Supabase database storage for projects
2. Update `ProjectService` to use real CRUD operations
3. Ensure frontend refreshes project list after creation

## Issue 2: Missing Database Persistence

### Problem
- All data is currently mock/in-memory
- No actual Supabase table operations
- Projects created but not stored in database

### Solution Required
1. Implement Supabase project table operations
2. Add proper Row Level Security (RLS)
3. Update all services to use real database calls

## Issue 3: UI/UX Improvements Needed

### Current Issues
- Console warnings about React Router
- No proper loading states during project creation
- Missing error handling and user feedback
- Dashboard doesn't auto-refresh after actions

### Required Improvements
1. Add proper loading spinners and states
2. Implement error boundaries and user feedback
3. Add auto-refresh mechanisms
4. Fix React Router future flag warnings
5. Improve overall user experience

## Issue 4: Video Upload & Storage

### Problem
- Video recording works but may not persist properly
- Need to verify Supabase storage integration
- File upload paths may not be correctly configured

### Solution Required
1. Test and verify video upload to Supabase Storage
2. Ensure proper file paths and permissions
3. Add progress indicators for uploads

## Priority Order for Fixes

1. **HIGH PRIORITY**: Implement real Supabase project storage
2. **HIGH PRIORITY**: Fix frontend state management for project list
3. **MEDIUM PRIORITY**: Improve UI/UX with loading states and error handling
4. **MEDIUM PRIORITY**: Verify and fix video upload functionality
5. **LOW PRIORITY**: Address console warnings and minor UX issues
