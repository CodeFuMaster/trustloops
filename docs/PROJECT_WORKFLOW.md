# TrustLoops Project Workflow Guide

## What is TrustLoops?

TrustLoops is a testimonial collection and display platform that allows businesses to easily collect video and text testimonials from their customers and display them in beautiful testimonial walls that can be embedded on websites.

## How It Works

### 1. **User Authentication**
- Users log in using Supabase Magic Link authentication (passwordless email login)
- Simply enter your email address and click the magic link sent to your inbox
- The system uses JWT tokens to keep you logged in securely

### 2. **Dashboard - Project Management**
- After login, you land on the main Dashboard
- View all your testimonial collection projects
- Each project represents a product or service you want to collect testimonials for
- Sample project "Sample Product" is provided for testing

### 3. **Creating New Projects**
- Click "Create New Project" from the Dashboard
- Enter project name and description
- System automatically generates a unique "slug" (URL-friendly identifier)
- Each project gets a unique collection URL for customers

### 4. **Collecting Testimonials**

#### For Business Owners:
- **Copy Collection Link**: Get the unique URL to share with customers
- Share this link via email, social media, or your website
