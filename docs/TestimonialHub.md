# TestimonialHub - Authentic Video Testimonials Made Simple

## 🎯 Goal (Why it exists)

Help founders collect authentic video/text testimonials in minutes and display them on their site without touching code. More social proof → higher conversions → more sales.

## 🔄 High-Level Workflow (in plain words)

### 1. **Create a project** 
The SaaS owner signs into the dashboard, clicks "New Project," and gets a unique collection link.

### 2. **Share the link** 
They email or DM the link to happy customers.

### 3. **Record a testimonial** 
Customer lands on a simple page, presses "Record," speaks for 30 sec, adds a text quote, hits Send.

### 4. **Approve** 
Owner sees new submissions in their dashboard, watches the clip, and clicks Approve or Delete.

### 5. **Showcase** 
An embed script (`<script src="widget.js">`) drops a responsive wall of approved testimonials on any website or Notion page.

### 6. **Upsell** 
Free tier = 5 testimonials + TrustLoops badge. Upgrade (€9+/mo) for unlimited videos and no badge.
