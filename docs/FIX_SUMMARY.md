# Fix Summary - Project Creation Issue

## Problem Resolved
**Issue**: Project creation was working in the backend but not showing in the frontend Dashboard.

## Root Cause
Both `ProjectService` and `SupabaseClientWrapper` were only returning hardcoded mock data instead of actual user projects.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated SupabaseClientWrapper (src/Infrastructure/Services/SupabaseClientWrapper.cs)
- **Added in-memory storage**: Static list to store created projects until full database integration
- **Enhanced GetProjectsAsync**: Now filters projects by user ID and returns actual user projects
- **Enhanced CreateProjectAsync**: Now adds created projects to in-memory storage
- **Added GetProjectBySlugAsync**: New method to get projects by slug for wall display

### 2. Updated ProjectService (src/WebApp/Services/ProjectService.cs)
- **Removed mock data**: No longer returns hardcoded sample projects
- **Uses Supabase wrapper**: Now delegates all operations to SupabaseClientWrapper
- **Proper error handling**: Returns database operation results instead of mock data

### 3. Fixed Frontend Integration
- The Dashboard component was already correctly implemented to add new projects to state
- Issue was backend not persisting or returning real project data

## Technical Details

### Before Fix:
```csharp
// Always returned same hardcoded project
var sampleProject = new Project { /* hardcoded data */ };
return Result.Ok(new List<Project> { sampleProject });
```

### After Fix:
```csharp
// Returns actual user projects from storage
var userProjects = _projects.Where(p => p.UserId == userId).ToList();
return Task.FromResult(Result.Ok(userProjects));
```

## Testing Results
- âœ… Projects now persist between sessions (in-memory storage)
- âœ… Dashboard shows newly created projects immediately
- âœ… User-specific project filtering works correctly
- âœ… Wall functionality works with real project data
- âœ… Backend logs show proper project creation and retrieval

## Files Modified
1. `src/Infrastructure/Services/SupabaseClientWrapper.cs` - Added in-memory storage and user filtering
2. `src/WebApp/Services/ProjectService.cs` - Removed mock data, uses Supabase wrapper
3. `docs/PROGRESS.md` - Updated with current status
4. `docs/CURRENT_ISSUES.md` - Documented issues and solutions
5. `docs/SETUP_GUIDE.md` - Created setup documentation
6. `docs/API_DOCUMENTATION.md` - Created API documentation

## Current Status
- **Project Creation**: âœ… Fully functional
- **Project Display**: âœ… Shows real user projects
- **Wall Display**: âœ… Works with created projects
- **Authentication**: âœ… User-specific project isolation
- **Data Persistence**: ðŸ”„ In-memory (next step: full Supabase integration)

## Next Steps for Full Database Integration
1. Implement actual Supabase table operations
2. Add Row Level Security (RLS) policies
3. Replace in-memory storage with database queries
4. Add proper error handling for database failures
